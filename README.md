# Gundla Gårdscafé
School assignment at YRGO. During four weeks we developed a web page for Gundla Gårdscafé together with designer students. Since the customer in this case was not interested in coding herself, we have used the CMS system *Sanity* so that the customer can manage the website herself. On the front end, we have used the React based framework *Next.js* which worked really well with Sanity since it made it possible to use JavaScript on both the front- and the backend.
